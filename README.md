# Fred ![Introducing Fred](http://www.jasonrectorweb.com/images/fred-1.jpg)

### A personal Front-End [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) Generator

### More coming soon - this documentation is a work in progress.

This is a generator I made to start responsive website projects. Your project doesn't have to be responsive, though. It uses SASS and has a gruntfile that I think covers pretty much everything I have needed to do.

![Fred has many features](http://www.jasonrectorweb.com/images/fred-2.jpg)
## Features

- Uses SASS for CSS preprocessing
- Installs [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) (optional)
- Installs [jRespond](https://github.com/ten1seven/jRespond) (optional) for managing your javascript on a responsive site
- Installs [jPanelmenu](http://jpanelmenu.com/) (optional) for an easy way to handle mobile navigation
- Installs [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) (optional) in case you need some nifty javascript templating

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- If you're using Yeoman, you probably already have [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) installed. But if not, do that.
- The grunt task to build for production uses grunt-imageoptim. For this to work you need to install [Image Optim](https://imageoptim.com/). If not, you can comment that out of the task. But don't forget to optimize your images some other way!!
