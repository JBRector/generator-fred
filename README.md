### A personal Front-End [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) Generator

### More coming soon - this documentation is a work in progress.

This is a generator I made to start responsive website projects. Your project doesn't have to be responsive, though. It uses SASS and has a gruntfile that I think covers pretty much everything I have needed to do.

## Features

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- If you're using Yeoman, you probably already have [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) installed. But if not, do that.
- The grunt task to build for production uses grunt-imageoptim. For this to work you need to install [Image Optim](https://imageoptim.com/).

## Usage

Install - Coming soon (not yet published)

To start a local development server with node: `grunt server`
To build for production: `grunt`
